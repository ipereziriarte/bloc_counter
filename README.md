# counter_app

A basic flutter app that uses BLoC as state management system and architecture

## Getting Started

This branch introduces the BLoC testing.

First, make sure `pub` command is enabled by running on the terminal:
`flutter pub global activate encrypt`  

Second, install the [PubSpec assist plugin for vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jeroen-meijer.pubspec-assist)

And add the recommended bloc_test and flutter test extensions.

Finally run the tests either from the editor or on the terminal with `pub run test` if that doesn't work run `flutter test path_to_file.dart`. I.e: `flutter test test/cubit/counter_cubit_test.dart`

You can get more info about flutter testing at [flutter test docs](https://pub.dev/packages/test#running-tests) and [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/testing/unit/introduction)
